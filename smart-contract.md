Implement smart contracts to automate enforcement in RootStock and Ethereum. We can write your smart contract's code securely.

## What are Smart Contracts?

A smart contract is a computer code that predefines a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other. Once the pre defined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. The code facilitates, verifies, and enforces the negotiation or performance of an agreement or transaction. This is the simplest form of decentralized automation. Smart contracts help you send and receive money, shares, property, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free and predefined way while avoiding the services of a middleman.

## Features

Smart contracts are capable of tracking performance in real time, and can bring huge cost savings. Compliance and controlling happen on the fly. In order to get external information, a smart contract needs information oracles, which fetches the information.

Smart Contracts are,

* Self-verifying
* Self-executing
* Tamper resistant

**Smart Contracts can;**

* Turn legal obligations into automated processes.
* Guarantee a greater degree of security.
* Decrease reliance on trusted intermediaries.
* Lower transaction costs
